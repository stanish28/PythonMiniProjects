# PythonMiniProjects 

These are some mini projects where I used different libraries of python like Tkinter and requests to create some small projects.
1 - Date Picker: It displays a calender and when you select a date it outputs the date selected on the screen
2 - City Weather: It uses an api of the OpenWeatherApp website and gives the weather data of the city entered.
3 - Dice Roll: It shows an animation of rolling a dice.
